Hey. Why the long face?

1009
01:00:58,689 --> 01:01:01,203
It was all just a
stupid mistake.

1010
01:01:02,235 --> 01:01:05,910
I never should have rescued her
from that tower in the first place.

1011
01:01:08,283 --> 01:01:10,114
I hate Mondays.

1012
01:01:10,285 --> 01:01:13,755
I can't believe you'd walk away from
the best thing that happened to you.

1013
01:01:13,996 --> 01:01:15,509
What choice do I have?

1014
01:01:15,664 --> 01:01:18,974
She loves that pretty
boy, Prince Charming.

1015
01:01:19,209 --> 01:01:21,200
Come on. Is he really
that good-looking?

1016
01:01:21,379 --> 01:01:23,734
Are you kidding?
He's gorgeous!

1017
01:01:23,923 --> 01:01:26,995
He has a face that looks like
it was carved by angels.

1018
01:01:27,218 --> 01:01:29,686

- You know...

1019

making me feel any better.

Look, guys. It's for the best.

1021
01:01:40,063 --> 01:01:41,416
Mom and Dad approve,

1022
01:01:41,565 --> 01:01:44,762
and Fiona gets the man
she's always dreamed of.

1023
01:01:44,985 --> 01:01:46,782
Everybody wins.

1024

Except for you.

1025
01:01:49,239 --> 01:01:52,390
I don't get it, Shrek.
You love Fiona.

1026
01:01:52,617 --> 01:01:53,891
Aye.

1027
01:01:54,953 --> 01:01:57,421
And that's why I
have to let her go.

1028
01:01:58,331 --> 01:02:01,289
Excuse me, is she here?

1029
01:02:01,501 --> 01:02:03,537
She's, uh... in the back.

1030
01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:06,639
Oh, hello again.

1031
01:02:10,969 --> 01:02:13,005
Fairy Godmother. Charming.

1032
01:02:13,179 --> 01:02:17,297
You'd better have a good reason for
dragging us down here, Harold.

1033
01:02:17,558 --> 01:02:23,110
Well, I'm afraid Fiona isn't really...
warming up to Prince Charming.

1034
01:02:23,439 --> 01:02:26,795
- FYI, not my fault.
- No, of course it's not, dear.

1035
01:02:27,068 --> 01:02:28,786
I mean, how charming can I be

1036
01:02:28,945 --> 01:02:31,254
when I have to pretend
I'm that dreadful ogre?

1037
01:02:31,447 --> 01:02:33,403
No, no, it's nobody's fault.

1038
01:02:33,574 --> 01:02:36,725
Perhaps it's best if we just
call the whole thing off, okay?

1039
01:02:36,952 --> 01:02:41,150
- (BOTH) What?
- You can't force someone to fall in love!

1040
01:02:41,414 --> 01:02:44,451
I beg to differ. I
do it all the time!

1041
01:02:44,668 --> 01:02:48,946
Have Fiona drink this and she'll fall
in love with the first man she kisses,

1042
01:02:49,214 --> 01:02:51,091
which will be Charming.

1043
01:02:52,259 --> 01:02:55,137
- Umm... no.
- What did you say?

1044
01:02:55,345 --> 01:02:57,620
I can't. I won't do it.

1045
01:02:57,806 --> 01:02:59,319
Oh, yes, you will.

1046
01:02:59,474 --> 01:03:02,910
If you remember, I helped you
with your happily ever after.

1047
01:03:03,144 --> 01:03:06,534
And I can take it
away just as easily.

1048
01:03:06,773 --> 01:03:09,845
Is that what you want? Is it?

1049
01:03:10,944 --> 01:03:13,378
- No.
- Good boy.

1050
01:03:13,571 --> 01:03:15,209
Now, we have to go.

1051
01:03:15,365 --> 01:03:17,515
I need to do Charming's
hair before the ball.

1052
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:19,816
He's hopeless. He's all
high in the front.

1053
01:03:19,994 --> 01:03:22,713
He can never get to the back. You
need someone to do the back.
